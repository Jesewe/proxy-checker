### Summary

- **GUI-Only Version:** Removed all command-line interface (CLI) functionality. The application now launches directly into the PyQt6 graphical user interface.

- **Anonymity Detection:** Added functionality to determine whether a proxy is transparent (revealing the clientâ€™s IP) or anonymous.

- **Geo-Location Lookup:** Integrated geo-location data retrieval using the ip-api.com API to display country, region, and city details for each working proxy.
